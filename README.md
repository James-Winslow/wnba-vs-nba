# WNBA vs. NBA: Breaking Stereotypes

## Project Overview
This project aims to perform a comparative analysis of skill and athletic ability between WNBA and NBA players. By analyzing key performance metrics such as Field Goal Percentage (FG%), Free Throw Percentage (FT%), and Three-Point Percentage (3P%), we seek to challenge common stereotypes and highlight the similarities and differences in skill levels between players in the two leagues.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Web Scraping**: Gathering data from online sources using web scraping techniques.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handling missing values and preparing data for analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducting descriptive statistics to summarize data.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating clear and informative visualizations to compare datasets.
- **Storytelling with Data**: Drawing meaningful conclusions from the analysis.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and cleaned data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for different parts of the project.
  - `wnba_vs_nba_analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook containing data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data cleaning, web scraping, and analysis.
- `images/`: Folder for any images generated by the project (plots, charts, etc.).
- `docs/`: Documentation, including methodology, data sources, and explanations.

## Results and Conclusions
The analysis shows that while there are some differences in performance metrics between WNBA and NBA players, the skill levels are comparable in many aspects. This challenges the stereotype that there is a significant disparity in skill and athletic ability between the two leagues.
